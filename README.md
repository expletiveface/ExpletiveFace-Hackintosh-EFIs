# ExpletiveFace-Hackintosh-EFIs
EFI folder containing drivers and kexts used for an ExpletiveFace Hackintosh Build
These EFI folders are slightly modified copies of corpnewts EFI folders linked to the Vanilla Install guide posted on Reddits Hackintosh subreddit. 
The drivers and kexts included herein are relevant to my specific build, meaning some have been gathered from corpnewts page, while others were located elsewhere online. 
My hardware configuration can be located here https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mjy8QZ
The config.plist has been modified to blank out the IDs and Serial numbers of the parts associated with my specific machine. If in the event anyone copies my machine build and uses the files uploaded here to boot their own High Sierra Hackintosh, be warned that you still must use Clover Configurator to generate your own SMBIOS key (as outlined in the aforementioned Reddit post).
